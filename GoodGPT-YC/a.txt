In the stillness of the night, I write,
Words that dance in the pale moonlight.
Whispers of the stars above,
Tell stories of both loss and love.

The world in silence, wrapped in dreams,
As I pen down my soul's own schemes.
A symphony of thoughts unfurl,
In the quiet of this solitary world.

Through the ink, emotions flow,
In every line, a tale to sow.
With every word, a piece of me,
A glimpse of what I long to be.

In poetry, I find my grace,
A refuge in this sacred space.
A canvas for my heart's desire,
A spark to set my soul on fire.

So in these verses, I'll confide,
The depths of feelings that I hide.
In the poetry's gentle embrace,
I find my solace and my grace.
