In a classroom filled with code and screens,
We embarked on software dev dreams.
With lines of code that just won't compile,
We endured frustration mile by mile.

Syntax errors, bugs, and endless stacks,
Our patience strained, we watched our backs.
As algorithms danced and databases roared,
We yearned for simpler times, we implored.

In this software class, our minds did spin,
With every "404," it felt like a sin.
Debugging sessions, never-ending strife,
We dreamt of a bug-free, errorless life.

But through the struggle and countless tries,
We learned to debug, to optimize,
In a software class, both good and bad,
We found a passion, it's not all sad.
