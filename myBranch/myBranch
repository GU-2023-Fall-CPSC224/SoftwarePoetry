In a realm of words, I trip and tumble,
Lines in disarray, thoughts fumble.
Metaphors clash, like a rowdy brawl,
This poem's a mess, it's bound to appall.

Similes falter, like a kite unstrung,
Rhythm stumbles, like a song unsung.
Imagery's weak, like a fading ember,
This poem's a flop, a poetic September.
