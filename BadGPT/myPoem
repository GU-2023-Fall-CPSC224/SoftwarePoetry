In a land where words do fail,
I'll spin a tale, a sad detail.
A poem, though it may be bad,
I'll try my best, so don't be mad.

The sun did rise, the sky turned gray,
My rhymes are lost, they've gone astray.
Like socks that vanish in the night,
My verses too, have taken flight.

The flowers weep, the rivers sigh,
As I attempt to touch the sky.
But alas, my words are quite absurd,
Like a cat that thinks it's a bird.

So here's a poem, bad and crude,
I hope it brings a little mood.
Forgive the lines that lack in grace,
For in the end, it's just a trace.
