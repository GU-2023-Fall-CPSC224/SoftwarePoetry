In a realm of verses, I'll stumble and fall,
Crafting a poem, quite terrible overall.
With words that don't rhyme and a structure awry,
Here's a bad poem for you, and I won't even try.

The moon is a potato, the sun a purple shoe,
Stars are like pickles in a cosmic stew.
My words make no sense, like a fish in a tree,
This poem is so bad, it's painful to see.

Roses are gray, violets are a shade of green,
I'm losing my mind in this poem, it seems.
But I'll keep on writing, though it's quite absurd,
For a bad poem, my skills are truly unheard.

So there you have it, this poem's quite sad,
A trainwreck of verses, it's really quite bad.
But if you've enjoyed this poetic strife,
I'll gladly write a better one to brighten your life!
